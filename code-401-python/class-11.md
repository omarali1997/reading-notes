># Data Visualization

### Python offers several plotting libraries, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn and many other such data visualization packages with different features for creating informative, customized, and appealing plots to present data in the most simple and effective way.

## Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Matplotlib and Seaborn are python libraries that are used for data visualization. They have inbuilt modules for plotting different graphs. While Matplotlib is used to embed graphs into applications, Seaborn is primarily used for statistical graphs.

## Line Charts
### A Line chart is a graph that represents information as a series of data points connected by a straight line. In line charts, each data point or marker is plotted and connected with a line or curve. 


## Using Matplotlib

### We are using random data points to represent the yield of apples.

## Using Seaborn

### An easy way to make your charts look beautiful is to use some default styles from the Seaborn library. These can be applied globally using the sns.set_style function.

## Bar Graphs

### When you have categorical data, you can represent it with a bar graph. A bar graph plots data with the help of bars, which represent value on the y-axis and category on the x-axis. Bar graphs use bars with varying heights to show the data which belongs to a specific category.

## Histograms

### A Histogram is a bar representation of data  that varies over a range. It plots the height of the data belonging to a range along the y-axis and the range along the x-axis. Histograms are used to plot data over a range of values. They use a bar representation to show the data belonging to each range. Let's again use the ‘Iris’ data which contains information about flowers to plot histograms.
