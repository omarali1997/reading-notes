# Read 32 : Intro to Next.js & Tailwind CSS
## Intro to Next.js & Tailwind CSS
## What is Next.js?
### Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications.

### But what exactly do we mean by this? Let’s spend some time expanding on what React and Next.js are and how they can help.

### Building Blocks of a Web Application
### There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:

* User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
* Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
* Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
* Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
* Integrations - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.
* Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
* Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
* Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
* Developer Experience - your team’s experience building and maintaining your application.


## What is Tailwind CSS?

### Tailwind CSS, as per their own website is a "utility-first CSS framework" which provides several of these opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that you can use directly inside your markup to design an element.

### Some of the utility classes that I frequently use these days are:

* flex: Used to apply Flexbox to a <div>
* items-center: to apply the CSS property align-items: center; to a <div>
* rounded-full: to make an image circular, and so on
### Seriously, it's not possible for me to list all of them because there are so many of these utility classes. But the best part is, we do not have to write these utility classes ourselves and keep them in any global CSS file. We directly get them from Tailwind.

### You can get a list of all the utility classes Tailwind has to offer from the documentation page. Also if you are working in VS Code, you can install an extension called Tailwind CSS IntelliSense and it will give you auto-suggestions as you keep typing the utility classes, as shown in the image below.
