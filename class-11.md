1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

   | SQL    | NoSQL |
   | ----------- | ----------- |
   | For complex queries            |   not good fit for complex queries          |
   |     vertically scalable whereas        |     horizontally scalable        |
   |           table based databases   |     document based, key-value pairs        |
   |          primarily called as Relational Databases   |    primarily called as non-relational or distributed database         |
   |        Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres   |   MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb          |

># What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

* ### complex query intensive environment ,heavy duty transactional type applications

># What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

* ### ierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

># Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

* ### NoSQL

># Which type of database is best for scalability?

* ### SQL

># What does SQL stand for?

* ### Structured Query Language

># What is a relational database?

* ### is a collection of information that organizes data in predefined relationships where data is stored in one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows

># What type of structure does a relational database work with?

* ### rwos and columns

># What is a ‘schema’?

* ### organization of data and provides information about the relationships between the tables in a given database

># What is a NoSQL database?

* ### non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.

># How does it work?

* ### NoSQL databases utilize a hash function behind the scenes to transform each item’s primary key into a number that falls inside a predefined range. Assume a value between 0 and 100.This hash value and range are then used to decide where an item should be stored.

># What is inside of a Mongo database?

* ### collections

># Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why

* ### MongoDB is more flexible

># What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

* ### hardly made it out of the pre-production stages
